    description: "Garethans, as a race, were enormous, towering at heights of up to eight feet. But they were more than just tall; they were large, with thickset muscular bodies that held a strength that could crush boulders and bullish large heads with broad flat faces. Their skin did not soften their appearance for it ranged in color from a stoic gray to an impenetrable black and was so rough and leathery that most airborne projectiles failed to pierce it. Yet it was neither their size nor their strength that most physically distinguished them, but their head and back spikes. These spikes protruded over eight inches and a constant line of them began at their forehead, went up over the crown of their skull, and started down their spine before fading away. The spikes were more than just fearsome in appearance, they were deadly, capable of impalling a man with a head-butt",
